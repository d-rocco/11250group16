	<H1>What is GHI?</H1>
	<P>Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is the total amount of shortwave radiation received from above by a surface horizontal to the ground. The greater this index value is the better suited the location will be for solar panel install as there is more solar radiation available to take in convert to electricity. This fundamental index is the basis of most solar radiation measurement system designs, data quality assessments, and atmospheric radiative transfer models addressing the needs for solar resource data.</P>
