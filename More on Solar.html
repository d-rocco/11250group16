    <h2>Solar Panels</h2>
    <h3>Rooftop Solar Panels</h3>
    <p>Rooftop solar panels function under clear sunny skies. The most energy is produced when sunlight hits the panels directly, rather than at an angle.
      These panels absorb the sunlight's energy and produce direct current, flows to an inverter that converts the energy into alternating current,
    which is used to power homes and businesses.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.fpl.com/energy-my-way/solar/rooftop-solar.html">Private Rooftop Solar</a></p>
    <h3>Professional Help</h3>
    <p>It is recommended to install solar panels on roofs through a qualified professional who holds a certification to do so and that works with high-quality solar panels on a regular basis. 
      The industry-standard certification is awarded through the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP). </p>

    <h2>Florida Power and Light Economic Help and Solar Progression</h2>
    <h3>Solar Energy Centers</h3>
    <p>Solar energy centers use sunlight to generate cost-effective electricity, without the need for water or fuel and while placing little to no demand on public services, while catalyzing economic development.
      A single solar energy center generates over 200 jobs during construction alone and boosts local businesses through the purchase of goods and services.
      Furthermore, it generates hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax revenue per year for a local county and it tends to have no negative effects on property values in a given area.

    <h3>Solar batteries</h3>
    <p>Energy storage, enables Floridians to store the energy generated by a solar energy center and to send it to the grid where it's most needed.
      Thus, even under cloudy weather, homes can still be solar powered, so long as they are connected to the grid.
      Lastly, batteries in combination with microgrid technology enables transitions in energy sources between autonomous and grid-connected operations. 
      Reliable, autonomous power is greatly appreciated during emergency situations like hurricanes.

    <h2>Solar and Weather</h2>
    <h3>Climate</h3>
    <p>Florida lives up to its name as the Sunshine State with an average of 237 sunny days per year, over the 205 sunny days usually found in the U.S.
      Despite Florida being the Sunshine State, we also are known for having general precipitation about 115.4 days per year, compared to the U.S. average of 106.2.
      Precipitation is highly correlated with cloudy weather, which affects solar power and storage, so this is significant to understand and apply.

    <h3>Hours of Sunshine</h3>
    <p>Certain seasons provide more hours of sunlight on average than others. Typically winter seasons receive sunlight for around 7 hours, while summer seasons tend to receive
      sunlight on average for about 9 to 10 hours each day.

    <h3>Peak Sunlight</h3>
    <p>While hours of sunlight are great for solar power, the best sunlight for solar power that can be received are during peak sunlight hours, when the sun is highest in the sky.
      Peak sunlight hours are different for every home and location, but on average, fixed solar panels in Florida experience about 5.26 peak sunlight hours in winter seasons and 6.16 peak sunlight hours in summer seasons.
      Typically, 4 peak sunlight hours per day are enough for solar powered systems to operate at sustainable efficiencies. The following link provides a means to calculate your home's potential for peak sunlight hours.
