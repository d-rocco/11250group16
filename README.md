Project Details

Overall, the system is a website that is divided into three tabs, each with its own functional purpose!

Each webpage contains a navigation bar with tabs. The tabs will highlight and change color when a mouse hovers over them, indicating to a user that they are interactive. Clicking on a tab will send a user to another webpage on the website. 

Links to external websites are present and clickable on the More on Solar webpage. Clicking on one will send the user to another website. Basic external link functionality is applied to these links.!

The map tab contains an interactive map of Florida, acquired from Google Maps, divided into 9 separate zones, along with a legend. The map itself initializes over the state of Florida, which is divided into 9 zones, each with a respective color and opacity. Moreover, many sun markers are automatically initialized on the map along with a marker clarifying the legend. The zones and the legend are clickable and each one was created and designed using polygon functionality built into Google Maps. The map contains basic features from Google Maps, such as the ability to zoom in and out of the map, the ability to drag the map to a different location, the ability to enter a street view, and the ability to allow the map to enter full screen mode.

Automatically, upon opening the webpage, a notification will appear on the user’s browser, claiming that the webpage would like to know and track their current location. The user can interact with this notification and may choose one of the options presented on it. Clicking ‘Allow’ closes the notification and prompts a red marker to initialize on the map at their current location. Clicking ‘Block’ closes the notification, and does not track their current location.

The legend and its marker are clickable. Clicking on the legend or its marker will prompt an infographic to appear, explaining the color coding and the opacity present above and below the legend that was created through the use of polygons, and how it applies to the overall suitability and preferability of solar power in a particular zone that shares a corresponding color and opacity. Moreover, the legend explains what GHI is to the user and how a particular GHI range for a zone justifies a zone’s given ranking. Lastly, the legend marker disappears if a user zooms in or out of the map.

Each zone is clickable. Clicking on a zone will prompt an infographic to appear, containing information regarding what the zone is, the coordinates the user clicked on, the site index for the zone along with the coordinates for that zone’s site index, and the zone’s ranked GHI index.

Within the map itself on the ‘Map’ webpage, users have the ability to zoom in and out of the map, the ability to drag the map to a different location, the ability to enter a street view, and the ability to allow the map to enter full screen mode. Users will be able to click on the Legend present on the map, and will have the ability to click on each of the 9 zones present on the map. Clicking on any of these will automatically open an infographic to the user, which is also itself scrollable and closeable.
